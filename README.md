# Fuzzy-logic-based-expert-system-in-agriculture
We have developed a Fuzzy logic-based Expert system for the purpose of training the data. We are focused mainly on a collection of more precise and authentic data directly from the farmers or people engaged in the process. The proposed fuzzy expert system's performance was created in MATLAB. We developed the criteria based on professional understanding, and we selected these rules to analyze the data set.
